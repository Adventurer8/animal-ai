# Animal-AI 3 (BETA)

AAI supports interdisciplinary research to help better understand human, animal, and artificial cognition. It also supports AI research towards unlocking cognitive capabilities and will also help track progress towards those with societal implications.

## Version

The environment will be undergoing heavy development over the next few years. The only new features in this Beta release (v2.1) are upgrading to MLAgents 2.0 and adding agent global location and raycasts to the observation space and it should be functionally similar to the [old version](https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics). Due to the large number of changes planned, it is unlikely that continuity between releases will be maintained going forwards.

## This Repo

This repo contains some introductory python scripts for interacting with the training environment as well as the [900 tasks](competition_configurations) which were used in the original Animal-AI Olympics competition. Details of the tasks can be found on the [AAI website](http://animalaiolympics.com/AAI/testbed) where they can also be played and competition entries watched. More tutorials and documentation (as well as environment features) will be added as we approach 3.0.

The environment is built using [Unity ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs) release 2 (python package 0.26.0).

## Requirements

First **download the environment** for your system:

| OS | Environment link |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | [download v2.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mcrosby/aai_builds/AnimalAI_WINDOWS_2.1.zip) |
| Mac | [download v2.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mcrosby/aai_builds/AnimalAI_MAC_2.1.zip) |
| Linux |  [download v2.1](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mcrosby/aai_builds/AnimalAI_LINUX_2.1.zip) |

Unzip the **entire content** of the archive to the `env` folder. On linux you may have to make the file executable by running `chmod +x env/AnimalAI.x86_64`. Note that the env folder should contain the AnimalAI.exe/.x86_84/.app depending on your system and *any other folders* in the same directory in the zip file.

The Animal-AI environment and packages are currently only tested on linux with python 3.8 but should also work on Windows and Mac.

**The Unity Project** for the environment will be made available later. If you would like access for your research please get in contact. 

## Manual Control

If you launch the environment directly from the executable or through the `play_config.py` script it will launch
 in player mode. Here you can control the agent with the following:

| Keyboard Key  | Action    |
| --- | --- |
| W   | move agent forwards |
| S   | move agent backwards|
| A   | turn agent left     |
| D   | turn agent right    |
| C   | switch camera       |
| R   | reset environment   |

## While Still in Beta

For now many of the documentation from [version 2](https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics) may be a useful reference until everything is fully migrated and updated. Further the documentation for [mlagents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) is very good and includes a lot of useful examples.
