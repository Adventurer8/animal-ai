## Overview

The [Animal-AI Testbed](http://animalaiolympics.com/AAI) is used to study the cognitive abilities of artificial agents. It provides a research environment to help build and test AI systems with the common sense physical reasoning abilities found in many animals. Most modern AI benchmarks are solvable without common sense reasoning whereas Animal-AI is designed to isolate and measure such abilities.

The environment will be undergoing heavy development over the next few years. This initial 3.0.0 release is designed to work just like the old version. Internally, AAI has been rewritten, but externally it should work in roughly the same way. The only new features (for now) are adding agent global location and raycasts to the possible observations. Future releases plan to include a flag to be compatible with the 3.0.0 version, but, due to the large number of changes planned, it is unlikely that exact continuity between releases will be maintained.

This repo contains the [training environment](animalai), a [training library](animalai_train) as well as the [900 tasks](competition_configurations) which were used in the original Animal-AI Olympics competition. Details of the tasks can be found on the [AAI website](http://animalaiolympics.com/AAI/testbed) where they can also be played and competition entries watched.

The environment is built using [Unity ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs). This version uses release 2 (0.26.0).

## Requirements

First **download the environment** for your system:

| OS | Environment link |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | TODO |
| Mac | TODO |
| Linux |  TODO |

Unzip the **entire content** of the archive to the `examples/env` folder. On linux you may have to make the file executable by running `chmod +x env/AnimalAI.x86_64`.

The Animal-AI packages are currently only tested on linux with python 3.8

**The Unity source files** for the environment will be made available later. If you need them for your research please get in contact. 

## Manual Control

If you launch the environment directly from the executable or through the `load_config_and_play,py` script it will launch
 in player mode. Here you can control the agent with the following:

| Keyboard Key  | Action    |
| --- | --- |
| W   | move agent forwards |
| S   | move agent backwards|
| A   | turn agent left     |
| D   | turn agent right    |
| C   | switch camera       |
| R   | reset environment   |

## Citing
If you use the Animal-AI environment in your work you can cite the environment paper:
